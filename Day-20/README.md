## What it means for a PV to not have storageClassName
- When you omit the storageClassName field from a PersistentVolume definition, or explicitly set it to an empty string (storageClassName: ""), it signifies that this PV does not belong to any particular StorageClass.
## Here's the binding logic:
- PVC requests storageClassName: "": This explicitly tells Kubernetes: "I want to bind to a PV that also has an empty or unset storageClassName."
- PV has no storageClassName (or storageClassName: ""): This PV is considered to be in the "no class" category.
- Since both the PVC and the PV are in this "no class" category, and if all other criteria (access modes, capacity) are met, they will bind.
