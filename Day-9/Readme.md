To verify whether your Kubernetes **Job** has completed, you can use the following commands:

---

### ✅ **1. Check Job Status**

```bash
kubectl get jobs hello-k8s-job
```

This will show output like:

```
NAME             COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-k8s-job    1/1           10s        1m
```

If you see `1/1` under COMPLETIONS, it means the job completed successfully.

---

### ✅ **2. Describe the Job (for more detail)**

```bash
kubectl describe job hello-k8s-job
```

This will show detailed status, including events like `Completed successfully`.

---

### ✅ **3. Check the Pod Created by the Job**

List the pods associated with the job:

```bash
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=hello-k8s-job
```

Output will show the pod name and its status. For example:

```
hello-k8s-job-xxxxx   Completed   ...
```

---

### ✅ **4. View Logs to Confirm Job Output**

Once the pod is `Completed`, check the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

You should see:

```
Hello from my Kubernetes Job!
Task Finished Successfully!
```
