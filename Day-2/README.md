Demonstrating Selectors with kubectl get
This guide will show you how to use kubectl get with selectors to filter and retrieve specific Kubernetes Pods based on their attached labels.

Prerequisites:

A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., via Docker Desktop).

kubectl command-line tool configured.

The following Pods deployed in your cluster (ensure they are running and healthy):

nginx-v1-dev-pod (with labels: app: nginx, environment: dev, version: "1.0", tier: frontend)

nginx-v2-prod-pod (with labels: app: nginx, environment: prod, version: "2.0", tier: frontend)

db-pod (with labels: app: database, environment: dev, type: postgres)

Step 1: View All Pods and Their Labels
First, let's see all the Pods currently running in your default namespace and inspect the labels attached to them.

Bash

kubectl get pods --show-labels
Expected Output:
You will see a list of your pods with an additional column showing their labels. This helps you confirm what labels are present on each Pod.

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
db-pod              1/1     Running   0          5m      app=database,environment=dev,type=postgres
nginx-v1-dev-pod    1/1     Running   0          5m      app=nginx,environment=dev,tier=frontend,version=1.0
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          5m      app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
Step 2: Basic Equality Selector (-l key=value)
Use the -l (or --selector) flag to filter Pods that have a specific label with an exact value.

a. Find all Nginx Pods:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
What it does: This command tells Kubernetes to show only those Pods that have the label app with the value nginx.

Expected Output:
You should only see the nginx-v1-dev-pod and nginx-v2-prod-pod.

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
nginx-v1-dev-pod    1/1     Running   0          6m      app=nginx,environment=dev,tier=frontend,version=1.0
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          6m      app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
b. Find all Development Environment Pods:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l environment=dev
What it does: This selects Pods labeled with environment: dev.

Expected Output:
You should see db-pod and nginx-v1-dev-pod.

NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
db-pod             1/1     Running   0          7m    app=database,environment=dev,type=postgres
nginx-v1-dev-pod   1/1     Running   0          7m    app=nginx,environment=dev,tier=frontend,version=1.0
Step 3: Multiple Equality Selectors (AND Logic)
You can combine multiple selectors with a comma (,). This acts as an AND operation â€“ a Pod must match all specified labels to be selected.

a. Find Nginx Pods in the Production Environment:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l app=nginx,environment=prod
What it does: This will only show Pods that have both app: nginx AND environment: prod.

Expected Output:
You should only see nginx-v2-prod-pod.

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          7m    app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
Step 4: Label Existence Selector (-l key)
You can select Pods based on the presence of a label, regardless of its value.

Bash

kubectl get pods -l tier
What it does: This command lists all Pods that have the tier label defined.

Expected Output:
You should see both Nginx pods, as they both have the tier label.

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-v1-dev-pod    1/1     Running   0          8m    app=nginx,environment=dev,tier=frontend,version=1.0
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          8m    app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
Step 5: Label Non-Existence Selector (-l !key)
This selects Pods that do not have a specific label defined.

Bash

kubectl get pods -l '!tier'
What it does: This command lists all Pods that do not have the tier label.

Expected Output:
You should only see db-pod.

NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
db-pod   1/1     Running   0          9m    app=database,environment=dev,type=postgres
Step 6: Set-Based Selectors
These allow more complex filtering using in, notin, or exists operators. (Note: Use single quotes for the selector string).

a. Select Pods where environment is either dev OR prod:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (dev,prod)'
What it does: This lists Pods where the environment label's value is either dev or prod.

Expected Output:
You should see all three of your pods.

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
db-pod              1/1     Running   0          10m     app=database,environment=dev,type=postgres
nginx-v1-dev-pod    1/1     Running   0          10m     app=nginx,environment=dev,tier=frontend,version=1.0
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          10m     app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
b. Select Pods where version is NOT 1.0:

Bash

kubectl get pods -l 'version notin (1.0)'
What it does: This lists Pods that do not have version: 1.0.

Expected Output:
You should see nginx-v2-prod-pod and db-pod (since db-pod doesn't have a version label at all, it's considered not to be 1.0).

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
db-pod              1/1     Running   0          11m     app=database,environment=dev,type=postgres
nginx-v2-prod-pod   1/1     Running   0          11m     app=nginx,environment=prod,tier=frontend,version=2.0
Cleanup (Important!)
After your demonstration, remember to clean up the Pods you created:

Bash

kubectl delete pod nginx-v1-dev-pod nginx-v2-prod-pod db-pod
